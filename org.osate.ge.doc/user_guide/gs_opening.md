## Opening an Existing AADL Model
An existing AADL model can be opened in the graphical editor. Changes made to either the AADL source or the diagram will be reflected in the other.

1. Open an existing AADL source file.
	
2. Right-click the AADL package or component in the *Outline* view.
	
3. Select *Open Diagram* to open the diagram for the selected classifier. If a classifier is not selected,
   *Open Diagram* opens the package diagram for the selected package. The diagram will be created if one does
   not already exist. The appropriate diagram will appear in the graphical editor.
	
4. You can also use the keyboard shortcut ***Ctrl+Shift+V*** to switch between the selected element in the
   diagram and the selected element in the source file.
