## Opening an Associated Diagram
Diagrams associated with a particular element can be opened by double-clicking on the model element. For example, double-clicking a classifier inside a package diagram will open that classifier's diagram. Alternatively, the associated diagram can be open by right-clicking on the element and selecting *Open Associated Diagram* from the context menu.
